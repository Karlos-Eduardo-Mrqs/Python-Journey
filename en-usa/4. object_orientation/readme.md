# üì¶ Module 4 ‚Äî Object Orientation in Python

Master the fundamental concepts of object-oriented programming (OOP) to write more organized, reusable, and maintainable code!

## üîπ About this section

In this module, you will learn the basic principles of object orientation with Python, including class definition, object creation, encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.

OOP is one of the most widely used approaches to software development, as it makes it easier to model the real world within the code.

## üìñ Topics covered

1. **Classes and Objects**

- What are classes and objects
- How to define a class in Python
- Creating instances (objects)
- Attributes and methods

2. **Encapsulation**

- Public and private attributes
- Getter and setter methods
- Using *_* and *__* to indicate encapsulation

3. **Inheritance**

- Concept of inheritance and subclasses
- Code reuse
- Method override

4. **Polymorphism**

- Methods with the same name in different classes
- Using polymorphism for flexibility

5. **Magic Methods**

- *__init__*, *__str__*, *__repr__*, etc.

- Operator Overloading

6. **Abstract Classes and Interfaces**

- Introduction to abstract classes with abc
- Defining contracts with abstract methods

## ‚úçÔ∏è What you can do after this section

1. Create your own classes and objects in Python
2. Apply encapsulation principles to protect data
3. Use inheritance to create reusable class constructors
4. Understand and apply polymorphism in your projects
5. Use special methods to make your classes more powerful and Pythonic

## üöÄ Tips to get the most out of it

1. Start creating simple classes with basic attributes and methods to gain familiarity.
2. Use examples from your daily life to represent concepts such as inheritance (e.g.: Animal ‚Üí Dog).
3. Test encapsulation by defining private attributes and controlling access with getters and setters.
4. Explore special methods to customize the behavior of your classes.
5. Refactor codes that use loose functions to organize them into classes and methods, seeking reuse.
