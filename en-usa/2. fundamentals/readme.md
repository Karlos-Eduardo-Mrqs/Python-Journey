# 📘 Python Fundamentals

Master the essential structures that every good programmer needs to know!

## 🔹 About this section

Now that you've taken the first steps, it's time to delve deeper into the **fundamentals of the Python language**.

In this module, you'll learn how Python makes decisions, repeats actions, and organizes blocks of code into reusable functions.

These concepts are the **backbone** of any Python application, from the simplest scripts to the most robust systems.

## 📚 What you will learn

### 🔢 Operators

- Arithmetic
- Relational
- Logical
- Identity (`is` / `is not`)
- Members (`in` / `not in`)
- Assignment
- Bitwise

### ⚙️ Conditional Structures

- `if`, `elif`, `else`
- Nested conditionals
- Ternary operators

### 🔁 Repetition Structures

- `for`
- `while`
- `break` and `continue`
- Iteration functions: `range()`, `enumerate()`, `zip()` and etc ...

### 🧰 Functions

- Declaration with `def`
- Parameters and arguments
- Default and named arguments
- `return`
- Variable scope
- Functions anonymous with `lambda`

---

## ✍️ What you will be able to do after this section

- Create logic that makes decisions based on conditions.
- Automate repetitions with different types of loops.
- Modularize the code with simple and efficient functions.
- Use operators in a logical and precise way.

## 🚀 Tips to get the most out of it

- Try to solve small challenges at the end of each topic.
- Use comments to explain what you are doing — this reinforces the learning.
- Make changes to the examples to see how the behavior changes.
