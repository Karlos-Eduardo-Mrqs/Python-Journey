# 📦 Module 3 — Data Structures in Python

Master the main ways to store, organize, and manipulate information with Python!

## 🔹 About this section

In this module, you will learn about the main native data structures in Python, which are key to developing efficient and well-organized programs.

Let's learn how to use lists, tuples, dictionaries, sets, and even list comprehensions — powerful features that allow you to handle data in a simple and elegant way.

## 📖 Topics covered

## Lists (`list`) 🟩

How to create, access, and modify lists. Useful methods and best practices for manipulating ordered collections.

## Tuples (`tuple`) 🟪

What tuples are, when to use them, and why their immutability can be an advantage.

## Dictionaries (`dict`) 🟨

Key-value structures. Perfect for representing meaningful information.

## Sets (`set`) 🟥

Unordered collections without duplicates. Ideal for operations such as union, intersection, and difference.

## Understanding structures 🌀

An elegant and fast way to create lists, dictionaries, or sets with a few lines of code.

# ✍️ What will you be able to do after this section?

- Use lists, tuples, dictionaries, and sets with confidence.
- Choose the best data structure for each situation.
- Create collections concisely using comprehensions.
- Write cleaner, more readable, and more efficient code.

## 🚀 Tips for getting the most out of it

- Try different data types (strings, numbers, lists within lists...).
- Use `print()` to understand what each structure stores.
- Explore the native methods available for each data type.
