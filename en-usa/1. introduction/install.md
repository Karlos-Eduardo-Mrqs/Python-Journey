# Installing and Configuring Python üêç

Before you start coding in Python, you need to make sure you have the language installed on your machine. Here are the steps to install Python and set up your development environment.

## 1. Installing Python

### On Windows:
1. Go to the official Python website: [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
2. Download the latest version for Windows.
3. Run the installer, making sure to check the **"Add Python to PATH"** option during installation.
4. After installation, open the **Command Prompt** and type `python --version` to verify that the installation was successful.

### On macOS:
1. Go to the official Python website: [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
2. Download the macOS installer and follow the installation instructions.
3. After installation, open **Terminal** and type `python3 --version` to verify that the installation was successful.

### On Linux:
Python usually comes pre-installed on most Linux distributions. To verify, run in **Terminal**:
```bash
python3 --version
```
## 2. Installing a Text Editor üñäÔ∏è

To code in Python, you'll need a text editor or an IDE (Integrated Development Environment). Some popular options include:

- **VS Code**: [Download VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- **PyCharm**: [Download PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/)
- **Sublime Text**: [Download Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/)

## 3. Testing the Installation üß™

After installing Python and your text editor or IDE, create your first Python script:

### Using an IDE (VS Code, PyCharm, or other):

1. Open your **IDE** (such as VS Code or PyCharm). 2. Create a new file named `hello_world.py`.

3. In the file, write the following code:

```python
print("Hello, World!")
```

4. Save the file.

### Setting up VS Code for Python:

Make sure to install the Microsoft Python extension in VS Code:

1. Click on Extensions (square icon on the left side or Ctrl + Shift + X).

- Search for Python.

- Install the official Microsoft extension.

- Run the script:

#### In VSCode:

Right-click on the file and select "Run Python File in Terminal".

Or press Ctrl + F5 to run without debugging.

#### In PyCharm:

Right-click on the file and select "Run 'hello_world'".

Or click the green ‚ñ∂Ô∏è button next to the print("Hello, World!") line.
