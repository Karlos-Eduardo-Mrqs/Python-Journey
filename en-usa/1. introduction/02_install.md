### On macOS

1. Go to the official Python website: [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2. Download the installer for macOS and follow the installation instructions.

3. After installation, open **Terminal** and type `python3 --version` to verify that the installation was successful.

### On Linux

Python usually comes pre-installed on most Linux distributions. To check, run in the **Terminal**:

```bash
python3 --version
```

## 2. Installing a Text Editor 🖊️

To program in Python, you will need a text editor or an IDE (Integrated Development Environment). Some popular options include:

- **VS Code**: [Download VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

## 3. Testing the Installation 🧪

After installing Python and your text editor or IDE, create your first Python script:

### Using an IDE (VS Code, PyCharm, or other)

1. Open your **IDE** (such as VS Code or PyCharm).

2. Create a new file named `hello_world.py`.

3. In the file, write the following code:

```python
print("Hello, World!")
```

4. Save the file with CTRL + S .

5. If you want the file to be saved every time you make a change:

### Setting up VS Code for Python

Make sure you install Microsoft's Python extension in VS Code:

1. Click Extensions (square icon on the left side or Ctrl + Shift + X).

- Search for Python.

- Install the official Microsoft extension.

- Run the script

#### Without VSCode

Right-click the file and select **"Run Python File in Terminal".

Or press Ctrl + F5 to run without debugging.

#### Without PyCharm

Right-click the file and select "Run 'hello_world'".

Or click the green ▶️ button next to the print("Hello, World!") line.
