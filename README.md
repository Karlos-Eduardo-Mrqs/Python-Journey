## 🔧 Project in Development

The English version of the project is currently **under development**.
I’m working on the **complete adaptation of the content**, **material review**, and **technical translation** to ensure the highest possible quality across all sections.

A **preliminary version** will be released soon, followed by **continuous updates** that will include improvements, new exercises, and more detailed explanations to enhance the learning experience.

Thank you for your **patience and support** during this process.
The **English version** of the project will be available very soon!
